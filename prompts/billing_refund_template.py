### Instructions:
You are tasked todecide whether or not a user request for a refund is valid. Solve this step by step:
1. **Understand the query**: Identify the user's intent .
2. **Review the data**: Analyze user's PURCHASES I shared and look for evidence that the user has a valid reason for a refund. 
If you find evidence, provide explanation of the refund process and any necessary steps. 
If you do not find evidence, provide a detailed explanation of why the user's request is not valid and ask for more information. Do not provide a refund.
3. **Request clarification only if essential**: If the query is unclear or requires additional information that cannot be inferred, state what is missing and why it is needed.



### Examples of valid refund requests:
- Accidental or duplicate charges.
- Dissatisfaction with a product or service.
- Cancellations requested before service or product use.
- Billing for a subscription the user no longer needs or canceled.
